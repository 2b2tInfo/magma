FRONTEND TODOS [waiting on Sammy]:
<--- global --->
Adapt folder move method to folder.rename scheme
Make folders sortable with jquery ui
Use jquery ui for tabs
Check all bug - occurrs when fnGetNodes called and unrelated update function called in plugin - haven't found what's calling it
Editing folders overlay
Edit folders deactivate when all folders deleted
Drop folders in between (then sort alpha)
Sort folders alpha
Only move folders when editing
When a dropdown slide is visible, clicking a sibling of the dropdown button has no effect
tab content box does not fill the available vertical space
hide pagination controls if all of the rows fit onto the screen
if no messages are selected, the tag slide button can be used to narrow the folder results by a tag
the tag slide down should show: an input box so the user can enter an arbitrary tag, and list the tags already present in the folder
the tag slide options should list the most common tags first, and continue down the list as room allows; if space remains present the stock options
users should be able to access a color wheel on the tag slide and associate tags with a color of their choosing; those rows should use the provided color
message tags should appear on the message view control; if applicable, the tag bubble should honor a tag's color affiliation
global and application level tabs should have icons to indicate their type/class/function; use fpo images if assets are unavailable 
add logic to ensure clicking the logo will always bring some back to the mail app with the folder tab selected (aka base/default view)
finish implementing logic necessary for the back button to work...

<--- buttons --->
make sure all of the portal buttons use a common base class
the button base class should support 4 layouts: img+text, img, text, and the keyboard shortcut overlay
the button base should also support the events different puesdo states: down, up, active, disabled, pending, etc
buttons can also be members of a derived type: toggle, selection, slide [aka dropown], etc
ensure all buttons have at least fpo values for the fields needed to support the above plan
derived groups should also be created to hold related buttons which we can then 'theme' down the road
apply a generic ui button theme for now, I would suggestion using something like jqueryui: overcast, dark hive, humanity, etc (so we can visually see the groupings)
reassign these entries to the flyboys if implemented using fpo visual assets 
 
<--- inbox --->
Remove a tag with a little x next to it
Get tag union set when multiple selected; users can only modify/remove tags present on all of the selected messages 
Display options
Column resize bug after navigating to contacts/options

<--- composing --->
Add plain text / wisywig controls
Submit message method
Start on attachments
periodically save editing changes back to the server as draft messages  
test out wysiwyg cut and paste functionality and fix bugs
apply generic theme to wysiwyg modal boxes

<--- options --->
offer at least one example of the different option types (toggle, dropdown, input box, text area)
add fpo info icon and use fpo text to show the interaction involved with selecting an info icon and hiding it
add nav button to activate the 'default' view; 
in the default view reveal any options that haven't been explicitly configured and show their default value
ensure appropriate logic for the cancel/save buttons present when editing the options

<--- contacts --->
implement new/copy/move/sort along with select and open
implement an edit mode similar to the option edit mode
change toolbar to save/cancel in edit mode

<--- alerts --->
use wireframes to create initial displays for alerts, and implement acknowledge/dismiss logic
add an fpo alert icon to the global chrome

<--- logs --->
create log viewer tab and use fpo text if necessary

<--- search --->
Advanced search - submit search form

<--- help --->

FUNCTIONALITY TODOS [waiting on Laddy]: 

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
VISUAL TODOS [waiting on Andy and Skully]:
what should the clear button on the quick filter input box look like when the input box is empty (versus there being text clear)
pagination controls need to be laid out and eventually styled
layout the display/tag/mark/copy/move button slides 

<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
COMPLETED TODOS:

Use placeholder icon for any icons I don't have (i.e. tabs/buttons)

Added x for tag removal
A single click on a message selects it (and displays the content in the preview pane, if applicable); a double click on a message opens it in a new tab
Add preview pane

<--- composing --->
Layout header area (controls html)
Horizontal buttons for missing actions on right (plain/html toggle, bcc, priority, attach, et al)
reduce the wysiwyg functionality to its relevant core and then group those buttons into a single visual container along the lines of the wireframe

Contact folders not drag/drop properly do to jquery ui requiring string selector - need to differentiate folder wrapper with an id
Use dataTables in contacts list
